# FinMaster
 Financial Time Management Tool

## 1. Overall
Currently available task planners, like kanban are for the general population, while we would like to develop a task planner specially for investors in the financial industry. It is convenient both for individual and group teams to set tasks, view latest financial news, allocate projects, compare performance, etc.

## 2. List of features

### A. Task Progress Statisitc
Users can see the progress of their tasks on the dashboard to optimize their task settings.

### B. Task planner and calendar reminder
Users can set daily recurring tasks or set reminders both on the dashborad and on the calendar. They can either quickly create daily tasks commonly used in different financial sectors (i.e., research, sales and trading) from the provided templates or customize personal tasks. Tags and participants can be added to each task.

### C. Securities information 
Once users have setted the securities or industry they are interest in, we will get security information from financial API, then show those info in our planner, saving customers some time. 

### D. Financial event reminder
Once users have set their area of interest or financial sector, we will crawl related news released in some mainstream financial websites for their reference. They can also choose to set alerts for future events mentioned in the news. It can shorten the usersâ€™ search time.
